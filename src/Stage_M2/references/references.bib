	abstract = {The cell nucleus is a mechanically responsive structure that governs how external forces affect chromosomes. Chromatin, particularly transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin, resists nuclear deformations through its mechanical response. However, chromatin also exhibits liquid-like properties, casting ambiguity on the physical mechanisms of chromatin-based nuclear elasticity. To determine how heterochromatin strengthens nuclear mechanical response, we performed polymer physics simulations of a nucleus model validated by micromechanical measurements and chromosome conformation capture data. The attachment of peripheral heterochromatin to the lamina is required to transmit forces directly to the chromatin and elicit its elastic response. Thus, increases in heterochromatin levels increase nuclear rigidity by increasing the linkages between chromatin and the lamina. Crosslinks within heterochromatin, such as HP1α proteins, can also stiffen nuclei, but only if chromatin is peripherally tethered. In contrast, heterochromatin affinity interactions that may drive liquid-liquid phase separation do not contribute to nuclear rigidity. When the nucleus is stretched, gel-like peripheral heterochromatin can bear stresses and deform, while the more fluid-like interior euchromatin is less perturbed. Thus, heterochromatin’s internal structure and stiffness may regulate nuclear mechanics via peripheral attachment to the lamina, while also enabling nuclear mechanosensing of external forces and external measurement of the nucleus’ internal architecture.},

	abstract = {Abnormalities in the shapes of mammalian cell nuclei are hallmarks of a variety of diseases, including progeria, muscular dystrophy, and various cancers. Experiments have shown that there is a causal relationship between chromatin organization and nuclear morphology. Decreases in heterochromatin levels, perturbations to heterochromatin organization, and increases in euchromatin levels all lead to misshapen nuclei, which exhibit deformations, such as nuclear blebs and nuclear ruptures. However, the polymer physical mechanisms of how chromatin governs nuclear shape and integrity are poorly understood. To investigate how heterochromatin and euchromatin, which are thought to microphase separate in vivo, govern nuclear morphology, we implemented a composite coarse-grained polymer and elastic shell model. By varying chromatin volume fraction (density), heterochromatin levels and structure, and heterochromatin-lamina interactions, we show how the spatial organization of chromatin polymer phases within the nucleus could perturb nuclear shape in some scenarios. Increasing the volume fraction of chromatin in the cell nucleus stabilizes the nuclear lamina against large fluctuations. However, surprisingly, we find that increasing heterochromatin levels or heterochromatin-lamina interactions enhances nuclear shape fluctuations in our simulations by a “wetting”-like interaction. In contrast, shape fluctuations are largely insensitive to the internal structure of the heterochromatin, such as the presence or absence of chromatin-chromatin crosslinks. Therefore, our simulations suggest that heterochromatin accumulation at the nuclear periphery could perturb nuclear morphology in a nucleus or nuclear region that is sufficiently soft, while stabilization of the nucleus via heterochromatin likely occurs through mechanisms other than chromatin microphase organization.},

	abstract = {Motivation Tyramide-based multiplex-immunofluorescence (mIF) enables the simultaneous analysis of up to seven protein markers on a whole slide, providing a comprehensive approach to study the tumor microenvironment. Integrating multiple mIF panels through image alignment of serial slide significantly expands the number of cell populations analyzed in a single space. IntegrAlign was developed to optimize this integration on serial whole slides, enhancing the value and applicability of mIF for comprehensive spatial analyses and enabling biomarker discovery at scale.
Results IntegrAlign, leveraging the SimpleITK toolkit, applies a two-step alignment using rigid and B-spline transformations to integrate serial mIF whole slides. Validation on simulated and real datasets demonstrated alignment accuracy below the diameter of a cell nucleus (∼6 µm), outperforming existing methods. This precision enhances spatial analyses by combining extended phenotypic data, supporting novel insights into tissue architecture and cellular interactions.

	abstract = {Many multicellular systems problems can only be understood by studying how cells move, grow, divide, interact, and die. Tissue-scale dynamics emerge from systems of many interacting cells as they respond to and influence their microenvironment. The ideal "virtual laboratory" for such multicellular systems simulates both the biochemical microenvironment (the "stage") and many mechanically and biochemically interacting cells (the "players" upon the stage). PhysiCell-physics-based multicellular simulator-is an open source agent-based simulator that provides both the stage and the players for studying many interacting cells in dynamic tissue microenvironments. It builds upon a multi-substrate biotransport solver to link cell phenotype to multiple diffusing substrates and signaling factors. It includes biologically-driven sub-models for cell cycling, apoptosis, necrosis, solid and fluid volume changes, mechanics, and motility "out of the box." The C++ code has minimal dependencies, making it simple to maintain and deploy across platforms. PhysiCell has been parallelized with OpenMP, and its performance scales linearly with the number of cells. Simulations up to 105-106 cells are feasible on quad-core desktop workstations; larger simulations are attainable on single HPC compute nodes. We demonstrate PhysiCell by simulating the impact of necrotic core biomechanics, 3-D geometry, and stochasticity on the dynamics of hanging drop tumor spheroids and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. We demonstrate stochastic motility, chemical and contact-based interaction of multiple cell types, and the extensibility of PhysiCell with examples in synthetic multicellular systems (a "cellular cargo delivery" system, with application to anti-cancer treatments), cancer heterogeneity, and cancer immunology. PhysiCell is a powerful multicellular systems simulator that will be continually improved with new capabilities and performance improvements. It also represents a significant independent code base for replicating results from other simulation platforms. The PhysiCell source code, examples, documentation, and support are available under the BSD license at http://PhysiCell.MathCancer.org and http://PhysiCell.sf.net.},

It uses XML to define a model and, traditionally, users needed to manually edit the XML to modify the model. PhysiCell Studio is a tool to make this task easier. It provides a graphical user interface that allows editing the XML model definition, including the creation and deletion of fundamental objects, e.g., cell types and substrates in the microenvironment. It also lets users build their model by defining initial conditions and biological rules, run simulations, and view results interactively. PhysiCell Studio has evolved over multiple workshops and academic courses in recent years which has led to many improvements. Its design and development has benefited from an active undergraduate and graduate research program.

While several multiscale methods are increasingly capable of connecting across scales, bridging molecular and cellular levels remains a challenge. Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a computational paradigm that models a complex system and its emergent properties from the perspective of its individual components whose behaviors are governed by a set of predefined rules. As long as these rules are biophysically accurate, the flexibility of this framework makes it uniquely positioned to fill the gap between spatially detailed and computationally efficient approaches and emerge as an effective mesoscopic modeling method that could bring valuable mechanistic insight into how complex behaviors arise in cellular environments. In this review, we summarize ABM principles and current capabilities in the realm of molecular biology and discuss potential directions for the development of additional features that would further broaden the scope of the method.},

It is the objective to use a three-dimensional Delaunay-triangulation as a basis for the definition of a triangulation of a subset of particles that form a surface. An essential problem of this objective is the conservation of the number of particles belonging to the surface. This excludes established surface reconstruction algorithms. The presented algorithm allows the definition of a triangulation within a subset of particles attributed to a surface without the deletion of particles. A particular challenge is the deletion of connection that infer three-dimensional structures in the surface. The presented method is suitable for many configurations. Its performance and its limitations are analyzed and discussed. The developed algorithm for the reconstruction of connections in a surface is suitable to be used for simulations of biological cells because of the inherent conservation of the number of particles attributed to the membrane.},

Annotating cell types is one crucial step for downstream analysis. However, many existing algorithms use an unsupervised strategy to assign cell types for SRT data. They first conduct clustering analysis and then aggregate cluster-level expression based on the clustering results. This workflow fails to leverage the marker gene information efficiently. On the other hand, other cell annotation methods designed for single-cell RNA-seq data utilize the cell-type marker genes information but fail to use spatial information in SRT data.We introduce a statistical spatial transcriptomics cell assignment model, SPAN, to annotate clusters of cells or spots into known types in SRT data with prior knowledge of predefined marker genes and spatial information. The SPAN model annotates cells or spots from SRT data using predefined overexpressed marker genes and combines a mixture model with a hidden Markov random field to model the spatial dependency between neighboring spots. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SPAN against spatial and nonspatial clustering algorithms through extensive simulation and real data experiments.https://github.com/ChengZ352/SPAN.},
